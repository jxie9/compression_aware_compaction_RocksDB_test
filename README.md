## CPRE 563: Advanced Data Storage Systems Final Project 
This is a fork of the original RocksDB (https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb).
An implementation of a compression-aware compaction mechanism is implemented in this project. Originally detailed in a survey [Jarnilla et al.], the compaction mechanism in question is simply an injection of some influence of the compression ratio. In general, it can be described as compaction ratio = (100/R) * N. The method of testbenching used in this project was db_bench. A couple relative db_bench calls can found below and the in our final project report /TODO: Link report. A function to determine the compact ratio of SST files dynamically during the db_bench as well. This compaction mechansim was also designed to work with a ScaleFlux CSD 3000. To do so, we have created a simple function to determine the CSD's compression ratio by invoking and parsing sfx-cap-info. More details can be found in our final report. /TODO: Link report

An example of a relavent db_bench call:
```
sudo ./db_bench --db=/home/path/to/test.db --benchmarks=fillrandom,stats --num=2000000 --key_size=16 --value_size=4096 --compression_type=none --stats_level=5 --stats_per_interval=1 --statistics=1 --disable_wal=true --compression_ratio=1 --seed=1745714556555094 --perf_level=3 2>&1
```
- Benchmarks set to fill with random keys and record statistics (We used the same seed across testbenches to ensure consistency during testing - more in our report)
- 2 GB size with key size of 16 and a value size of 4 kb
- No compression type (As we were using the ScaleFlux CSD, we wanted to use the transparent compression instead of invoking software compression)
- Output maximum statistic details (level 5) at performance level 3

## RocksDB: A Persistent Key-Value Store for Flash and RAM Storage

[![CircleCI Status](https://circleci.com/gh/facebook/rocksdb.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/facebook/rocksdb)

RocksDB is developed and maintained by Facebook Database Engineering Team.
It is built on earlier work on [LevelDB](https://github.com/google/leveldb) by Sanjay Ghemawat (sanjay@google.com)
and Jeff Dean (jeff@google.com)

This code is a library that forms the core building block for a fast
key-value server, especially suited for storing data on flash drives.
It has a Log-Structured-Merge-Database (LSM) design with flexible tradeoffs
between Write-Amplification-Factor (WAF), Read-Amplification-Factor (RAF)
and Space-Amplification-Factor (SAF). It has multi-threaded compactions,
making it especially suitable for storing multiple terabytes of data in a
single database.
